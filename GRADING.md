The grade is 19.75/20

* -0.25 Insert for Sorted is O(N).

* The tables 2 and 3 are good.

* All the other questions are answered correcly. (I deducted from the answers that NITEMS, PADLENGTH, and File Size increase run time).

* All the tests are passing.

* The coding style is reasonable.

* All the team members seem to have contributed adequately.
